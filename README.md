# firefat

The application aims to help people to lose weight. A group sets up a competition, where the winner is the individual with greater percentual weight loss. Between the start date and final date, all competitors must publish their weights in a periodic basis. A fee is applied to whom does not achieve the minimum weight loss in the elapsed time between the last and current weight measurements. Throughout the competition, all collected fees are saved, and the final amount is the winnerâ€™s prize. The app will allow each individual to enter its weight, enter its fee payments, see its progress, see the overall group progress, and the amount saved for the final prize.
