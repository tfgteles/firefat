      The application aims to help people to lose weight. A group sets up a competition, where the 
      winner is the individual with greater percentual weight loss. Between the start date and final date, all 
      competitors must publish their weights in a periodic basis. A fee is applied to whom does not achieve the 
      minimum weight loss in the elapsed time between the last and current weight measurements. Throughout 
      the competition, all collected fees are saved, and the final amount is the winnerâ€™s prize. The app will allow 
      each individual to enter its weight, enter its fee payments, see its progress, see the overall group progress, 
      and the amount saved for the final prize.

    <p>The main inspiration was not a Web App, but a group activity started in 2015 for mutual 
      motivation to lose weight. A group of friends, led by my sister, set up a WhatsApp group, a start and end 
      date, and a fee. Every Friday, they must send a picture of the scale with their weight, and who does not lose 
      at least 100g, pays a fee. The payments are collected and deposited in a piggy bank. By the end of the game, 
      whoever has lost the greatest percentual weight wins the piggy bank, with all the money saved from the fee 
      payments.
